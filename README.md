## Donate

Branta is free open source software. If you can, consider donating on [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/branta). All funds go towards improving and automating security for your stack.

## Known Limitations

- Spoof Wallets likely install to custom paths. Branta needs to have more flexible path scanning to catch these.
- Ongoing wallet support - Branta doesn't know about new releases unless we manually input them.
- "Do not disturb" turns off notifications. This disrupts the alert flow.


## Building
- XCode 14+
